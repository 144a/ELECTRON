# ELECTRON

Well, for all of you who hate electron configurations, here's your one and only solution. This program take the proton count of any element and returns the corresponding electron configuration, either in the long hand or short hand formats. It supports all the way up to Oganesson, or element 118. It displays a little awkwardly, so be wary of the text wrap on the screen. Have fun in chemistry!

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
